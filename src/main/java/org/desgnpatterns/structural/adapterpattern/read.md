Adapter Pattern
ğŸ”¸ the adapter pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
ğŸ”¸ it adapts an existing class to match a required interface
ğŸ”¸ it resolves the incompatibility between the interface a client expects and the interface an existing class provides.
ğŸ”¸ we would need to rewrite classes or modify clients, leading to code duplication and tight coupling if it didn't exist.
