Strategy Pattern
<br/>
ğŸ”¸ the strategy pattern is a design pattern that enables algorithms to be interchangeable at runtime.
<br/>
ğŸ”¸ it ensures that different algorithms are implemented using a common interface.
<br/>
ğŸ”¸ user can specify choose algorithm to use at runtime.
<br/>
ğŸ”¸ instead of changing a class's behavior with if-else or switch statements, it reduces code complexity by making the behavior injectable and replaceable from outside.
<br/>
ğŸ”¸ without strategy pattern, different strategies would be managed within a single class, violating the single responsibility principle and reducing code readability and testability.
