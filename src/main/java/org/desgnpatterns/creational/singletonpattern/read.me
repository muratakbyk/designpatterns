Singleton Pattern (Creational design pattern)
the main aim of singleton pattern is making sure of only one instance of a class's exist.
Because if might need only one instance of a class in the whole application, and we use Singleton Pattern
in such a case.
It reduces source and memory waste and protect the consistency for the whole application cycle.
For example if we need a logger, local cache, config manager for our application, we can use Singleton Pattern.
